# macropad-hotkeys
My own version of the Adafruit Macropad project https://learn.adafruit.com/macropad-hotkeys. This version creates a new keypress type called 'persistent' keypress, allowing a key to be held down like on a normal keyboard.

Included Macropads for Vim, Minecraft, Trackmania, and a different number pad.
